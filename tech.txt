nodejs - nodejs easier to get started, light weight webserver in 5 lines of code
		whereas in php you need apache and many other cofigurations to be done.

		best package management tool - npm (node package manager), easy to install and
		uninstall dependencies.

		PHP follows the typical client-server model. Every page request initiates your application; you load configuration parameters, connect to a database, fetch information and render HTML.

		A Node.js app runs permanently and it need only initialize once. \m/ 

		PHP and most other server-side languages use an obvious blocking execution model. When you issue a command such as fetching information from a database, that command will complete execution before progressing to the next statement. Node.js doesnâ€™t (normally) wait. Instead, you provide a callback function which is executed once the action is complete.

		 In most environments you'll find only limited pieces available in async flavors, but in Node everything (or nearly everything) is async-only. It's actually hard to write non-async code in Node!

		 better performance than django, flask.
